# ADMM-Code
Matlab and C++ Code for ADMM Simulation

## Matlab Code
Original ADMM implementation in Matlab is located in the Matlab folder

## C++ Code
ADMM C++ stand alone implementation is located in the CppApp folder

## To Do
* Remove Matlab libraries from Project 3
* Rename Project 3 folder
* Test BFGS performance

## Better performance for standalone C++ Mex program with Mingw compiler
1. Go to Matlab Addons and install the Mingw compiler
2. In the Matlab command window, enter 'mex -setup C++' and select the 'MinGW64 Compiler (C++)' compiler
